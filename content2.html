        <p>Smoking and vaping are addictive because of nicotine, a powerful chemical that directly affects the brain. When a person inhales cigarette smoke or vapor, nicotine quickly enters the bloodstream and travels to the brain within seconds. Once it reaches the brain, it triggers the release of dopamine, a chemical that creates feelings of pleasure, relaxation, and focus. This “reward” effect makes the brain connect smoking or vaping with feeling good, so the person starts to crave it again and again. Over time, the brain gets used to having nicotine, which leads to tolerance, meaning the person needs more of it to feel the same effect. When they don’t get nicotine, they may experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, stress, restlessness, or trouble concentrating. This cycle of craving, relief, and withdrawal traps people in addiction. For young people, the risk is even higher because their brains are still developing, which makes them more vulnerable to the long-term habit and the difficulty of quitting.</p>

        <p><h1>How to Stop Addiction towards Smoking and Vaping</h1></p>

        <p> Quitting smoking and vaping can be hard, but it is possible if you really set your mind to it. First, you need to have a strong reason why you want to stop, like wanting to be healthier, saving money, or not being controlled by a habit. It also helps to know when you usually feel the urge to smoke or vape—like when you’re stressed, bored, or hanging out with friends—and find something else to do instead, such as chewing gum, exercising, or just taking a deep breath. It won’t be easy, but if you stay consistent and ask support from friends, family, or even teachers, you can slowly break free from the addiction.</p>
