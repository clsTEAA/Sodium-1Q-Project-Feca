        <p><h1>Why do Youth Smoke and Vape?</h1></p>
        <img class="img2" src="Content1Image1.png">
        <p>Many young people smoke or vape for different reasons, and one of the most common is peer pressure. When friends or classmates do it, others may feel the need to join in just to fit in or look “cool.” Another factor is curiosity, since a lot of teens want to try new things without fully thinking about the risks. Social media and advertisements also play a big role, because vaping is often shown as trendy, harmless, or even stylish. For some, smoking or vaping becomes a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or boredom, especially during school or personal struggles, since nicotine gives a short sense of relaxation or escape. Others may simply think it makes them look older or more confident, but what many don’t realize is that these habits can quickly turn into addictions that are hard to break and can lead to serious health problems in the future.</p>

        <p>Many factors cause youth to smoke and vape, and one of the biggest is peer pressure, since teens often feel the need to join in when their friends are already doing it. Curiosity also plays a role, as many want to try something new without realizing the risks involved. Some young people use smoking or vaping to cope with stress, school pressure, or personal problems, believing that nicotine gives them relief or escape. The influence of media and advertisements also makes these habits seem trendy, stylish, or even harmless. In addition, the easy access to cheap vape products and cigarettes makes it more tempting for youth to experiment. Many also think that smoking or vaping makes them look older, braver, or more independent, while others simply lack awareness of the serious health risks and the danger of addiction.</p>
