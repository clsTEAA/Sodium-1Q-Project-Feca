                <p>The rising number of young people who smoke and vape has become a significant public health concern. While many adolescents experiment with these habits due to peer influence, curiosity, or stress, they often overlook the risks that come with them. Both smoking and vaping expose the body to harmful substances, with nicotine being the most addictive component. This chemical alters brain function, creating dependence that can be difficult to overcome. By examining the causes, effects, and dangers of these practices, we can better understand why youth are drawn to them and how awareness and prevention can protect their health and well-being.</p>

                <h2>Spread Awareness</h2>
                <p>Awareness is one of the most powerful tools in addressing the growing issue of smoking and vaping among youth. Many young people start these habits without fully understanding their long-term health risks, including lung damage, heart disease, and addiction to nicotine. By providing accurate information through schools, health programs, and online platforms, we can help students make informed decisions and resist peer pressure. Parents and teachers also play a vital role by guiding teenagers, setting positive examples, and encouraging open conversations about the dangers of these practices. When awareness is spread effectively, it not only prevents new cases of addiction but also supports those who are trying to quit, leading to healthier communities overall.</p>
